# Extending Activation Steering to Broad Skills and Multiple Behaviours
You can find the paper here [Still add link].
## Abstract
Current large language models have dangerous capabilities, which are likely to become more problematic in the future. Activation steering techniques can be used to reduce risks from these capabilities. To realize this aim, we investigate the efficacy of activation steering to reduce broad steering and multiple behaviours. First, by comparing the effects of reducing performance on general coding ability and Python-specific ability, we find that steering broader skills works equally well as steering narrower skills. Second, we steer models to become more or less myopic and wealth-seeking, among others. We find that combining steering vectors for multiple different behaviours into one steering vector was largely unsuccessful. On the other hand, injecting individual steering vectors at different places in a model simultaneously was mostly effective, with only a marginal reduction in general performance. Simultaneous steering might therefore a promising extension of current activation steering methods.
